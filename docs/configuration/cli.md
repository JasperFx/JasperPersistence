# Command Line Tooling

::: warning
As of v4.0, the usage of Marten.CommandLine shown in this document is only valid for applications bootstrapped with the .Net Core / .Net 5.0
[generic host builder](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/host/generic-host?view=aspnetcore-3.1) with Marten registered in the application's IoC container.
:::

There is a separate NuGet package called _Marten.CommandLine_ that can be used to quickly add command-line tooling directly to
your .Net Core application that uses Marten. _Marten.CommandLine_ is an extension library to [Oakton](https://jasperfx.github.io/oakton) that
is the actual command line parser in this case.

To use the expanded command line options to a .Net Core application bootstrapped by `IHostBuilder`, add a reference to the _Marten.CommandLine_ Nuget and ever so slightly change your `Program.Main()` entry point as shown below:

<!-- snippet: sample_SampleConsoleApp -->
<a id='snippet-sample_sampleconsoleapp'></a>
```cs
public class Program
{
    // It's actually important to return Task<int>
    // so that the application commands can communicate
    // success or failure
    public static Task<int> Main(string[] args)
    {
        return CreateHostBuilder(args)

            // This line replaces Build().Start()
            // in most dotnet new templates
            .RunOaktonCommands(args);
    }

    public static IHostBuilder CreateHostBuilder(string[] args) =>
        Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
            .ConfigureWebHostDefaults(webBuilder =>
            {
                webBuilder.UseStartup<Startup>();
            });
}
```

<!-- endSnippet -->

Or if you're on >= .Net 6, you can still use the Marten CLI options with the `WebApplication` style
of bootstrapping with a few changes. First, to completely enable the Weasel/Marten command line diagnostics,
you'll need to add this line of code:

<!-- snippet: sample_using_WebApplication_1 -->
<a id='snippet-sample_using_webapplication_1'></a>
```cs
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Easiest to just do this right after creating builder
// Must be done before calling builder.Build() at least
builder.Host.ApplyOaktonExtensions();
```

<!-- endSnippet -->

And finally, use Oakton as the command line parser and executor by replacing `App.Run()` with this line of code in your
`Program.cs` file:

<!-- snippet: sample_using_WebApplication_2 -->
<a id='snippet-sample_using_webapplication_2'></a>
```cs
// Instead of App.Run(), use app.RunOaktonCommands(args)
return await app.RunOaktonCommands(args);
```

<!-- endSnippet -->

Once the _Marten.CommandLine_ Nuget is installed and Oakton is handling your command line parsing, you should be able to see the Marten commands by typing `dotnet run -- help` in the command line terminal of your choice at the root of your project:

```bash
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Available commands:
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        check-env -> Execute all environment checks against the application
         describe -> Writes out a description of your running application to either the console or a file
             help -> list all the available commands
     marten-apply -> Applies all outstanding changes to the database based on the current configuration
    marten-assert -> Assert that the existing database matches the current Marten configuration
      marten-dump -> Dumps the entire DDL for the configured Marten database
     marten-patch -> Evaluates the current configuration against the database and writes a patch and drop file if there are any differences
      projections -> Rebuilds all projections of specified kind
              run -> Start and run this .Net application
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

If you're not using the dotnet CLI yet, you'd just need to compile your new console application like you've always done and call the exe directly. If you're familiar with the *nix style of command-line interfaces ala Git, you should feel right at home with the command line usage in Marten.

For the sake of usability, let's say that you stick a file named "marten.cmd" (or the *nix shell file equivalent) at the root of your codebase like so:

```bash
dotnet run --project src/MyConsoleApp %*
```

All the example above does is delegate any arguments to your console application. Once you have that file, some sample usages are shown below:

Assert that the database matches the current database. This command will fail if there are differences

```bash
marten marten-assert --log log.txt
```

This command tries to update the database to reflect the application configuration

```bash
marten marten-apply --log log.txt
```

This dumps a single file named "database.sql" with all the DDL necessary to build the database to
match the application configuration

```bash
marten marten-dump database.sql
```

This dumps the DDL to separate files per document
type to a folder named "scripts"

```bash
marten marten-dump scripts --by-type
```

Create a patch file called "patch1.sql" and
the corresponding rollback file "patch.drop.sql" if any
differences are found between the application configuration
and the database

```bash
marten marten-patch patch1.sql --drop patch1.drop.sql
```

In all cases, the commands expose usage help through "marten help [command]." Each of the commands also exposes a "--conn" (or "-c" if you prefer) flag to override the database connection string and a "--log" flag to record all the command output to a file.

## Projections Support

See [the Async Daemon documentation](/events/projections/async-daemon.md) for more information about the newly improved `projections` command.
