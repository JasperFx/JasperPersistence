# Migration Guide


## Key Changes in 4.0.0

V4 was a very large release for Marten, and basically every subsystem was touched at some point. When you are upgrading from V2/3 to V4 -- and even
earlier alphas or RC releases of 4.0 -- you will need to run a [database migration](/schema/migrations) as part of your migration to V4. 

Other key, breaking changes:

* All schema management methods, including assertions on the schema, are now asynchronous. We had to do this for Npgsql connection multiplexing.
* The [compiled query](/documents/querying/compiled-queries) syntax changed
* The [event store](/events/) support has quite a few additions
* [Projections](/events/projections/) in Marten have moved to an all new programming model. Some of it is at least similar, but read the documentation on projection types before moving a Marten application over
* The [async daemon](/events/projections/async-daemon) was completely rewritten, and is now about to run in application clusters and handle multi-tenancy
* A few diagnostic methods moved within the API
* Document types need to be public now, and Marten will alert you if document types are not public
* The dynamic code in Marten moved to a runtime code generation model. If this is causing you any issues with cold start times or memory usage due to Roslyn misbehaving (this is **not** consistent), there is the new ["generate ahead model"](/configuration/prebuilding) as a workaround.
* If an application bootstraps Marten through the `IServiceCollection.AddMarten()` extension methods, the default logging in Marten is through the standard
  `ILogger` of the application


## Key Changes in 3.0.0

Main goal of this release was to accommodate the **Npgsql 4.*** dependency.

Besides the usage of Npgsql 4, our biggest change was making the **default schema object creation mode** to `CreateOrUpdate`. Meaning that Marten even in its default mode will not drop any existing tables, even in development mode. You can still opt into the full "sure, I’ll blow away a table and start over if it’s incompatible" mode, but we felt like this option was safer after a few user problems were reported with the previous rules. See [schema migration and patches](/schema/migrations) for more information.

We also aligned usage of `EnumStorage`. Previously, [Enum duplicated fields](/documents/indexing/duplicated-fields) was always stored as `varchar`. Now it's using setting from `JsonSerializer` options - so by default it's `integer`. We felt that it's not consistent to have different default setting for Enums stored in json and in duplicated fields.

See full list of the fixed issues on [GitHub](https://github.com/JasperFx/marten/milestone/26?closed=1).

## Migration from 2.*

* To keep Marten fully rebuilding your schema (so to allow Marten drop tables) set store options to:

```csharp
AutoCreateSchemaObjects = AutoCreate.All
```

* To keep [enum fields](/documents/indexing/duplicated-fields) being stored as `varchar` set store options to:

```csharp
DuplicatedFieldEnumStorage = EnumStorage.AsString;
```

* To keep [duplicated DateTime fields](/documents/indexing/duplicated-fields) being stored as `timestamp with time zone` set store options to:

```csharp
DuplicatedFieldUseTimestampWithoutTimeZoneForDateTime = false;
```
