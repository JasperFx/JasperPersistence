# Immutable projections as read model

This use case demonstrates how to create immutable projections from event streams.

## Scenario

To make projections immutable, the event application methods invoked by aggregators need to be made private, as well as any property setters.

To run aggregators against such projections, aggregator lookup strategy is configured to use aggregators that look for private `Apply([Event Type])` methods. Furthermore, document deserialization is configured to look for private property setters, allowing hydration of the projected objects from the database.

This can be done in the store configuration as follows:

The serializer contract applied customises the default behaviour of the Json.NET serializer:

Given the setup, a stream can now be projected using `AggregateWithPrivateEventApply` shown above. Furthermore, the created projection can be hydrated from the document store:
