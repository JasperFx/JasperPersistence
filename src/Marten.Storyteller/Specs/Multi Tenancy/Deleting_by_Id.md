    |Blue  |All Users|Tom, Todd  |
    |Green |All Users|Bill, Sara |


'Tom' is owned by Blue, so nothing should happen here

|> Delete name=Tom, tenantId=Green
|> Querying
    [table]
    |> Querying-row tenant=Blue, Query=All Users
    ``` returnValue
    Tom, Todd
    ```



'Tom' is owned by Blue, so this should result in the doc being deleted

|> Delete name=Tom, tenantId=Blue
|> Querying
    [table]
    |> Querying-row tenant=Blue, Query=All Users, returnValue=Todd
